# Hi thereðŸ‘‹

- I'm Saketh, a student, and Android developer, passionate about building apps with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

- Through my [blog](https://sakethh.medium.com/), I share my experiences and personal insights on Android development, some of which have been accepted by the [Google Developer Library](https://devlibrary.withgoogle.com/authors/sakethh).

- All of my projects are available [here](https://github.com/sakethpathike?tab=repositories).

### Currently working on
- [Linkora](https://github.com/sakethpathike/Linkora) - Linkora is an Android project that focuses on making link organization simpler. From saving a single link individually to saving links in a folder for respective use cases, Linkora has almost all of them with a simpler UI.
